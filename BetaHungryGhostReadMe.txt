Use your ghost powers to phase through walls and collect all the fruit!! Beware of the owner- 
if you're visible while he's in the same room as you, it's game over! You must be fully visible to pick up the 
fruit.

Our level transition code doesn't work from levels 1-2. To see our full levels individually, please run Beta (first level), Level 2, then level 3. The game will load level 2 and 
then crash.

We also have a slight bug on levels 2 and 3, where the ghost spawns as invisible. Press X to see yourself and play!

Our Beta Requirements: "Final level, updated media assets (art and music), if doing top down one intermediate level, losing feature (restart room or game)"

We feel we met all of these requirements, and for the final, we plan to tweak the difficulty of each level, fix the level switch glitch,
improve the AI, and tweak the assets as well as add an intro menu.
