Prototype:

To play this prototype, the ghost can pass through the impassable walls after the player has turned invisible (using 'G'). Don't forget to hit 'G' again to 
become physical again so the ghost can eat the orange!

Go ghost - G
Move - Arrow Keys

For the prototype, we were told to enable moving between walls, transparency, and deciding on the layout of the game. This prototype demonstrates the primary 
playable features that the full game will have.

For the alpha, we will implement the enemy w/ patrol paths/AI, have a bar that measures how much food has been successfully consumed, and have completed a full 
starter level.
